        <h2>About</h2>
        <p><strong>About Me:</strong> I am a dedicated landscape architect with 2 years of experience in creating innovative and sustainable outdoor spaces. My journey in landscape architecture began with a degree in Landscape Architecture from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology(JKUAT), where I developed a deep appreciation for the harmony between nature and design. I believe in creating landscapes that not only meet the needs of clients but also contribute positively to the environment and community.</p>
